# Cyclify

Welcome to **Cyclify**, a posture-tracking app designed for cyclists. Built as part of our ECE Capstone at Carnegie Mellon University, Cyclify helps users improve riding form using pressure sensors, real-time alerts, and detailed post-ride analytics.

## App Overview

Cyclify connects to an ESP32 device embedded with pressure sensors via Bluetooth. It collects data during a ride, alerts users to poor posture using voice feedback, and visualizes their form performance after each ride. The app is iOS-native and uses SwiftUI, CoreBluetooth, SwiftData, and Swift Charts.
